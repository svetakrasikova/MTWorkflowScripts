# Version history
# v0.7.1	Last modified on 06 Jan 2015 by Ventsislav Zhechev
# Fixed a bug that came up when a full deployment could be completed while leaving some servers empty.
#
# v0.7		Last modified on 03 Nov 2014 by Ventsislav Zhechev
# Disabled the code dealing with setting up deployment commands for an XX–EN engine, as that engine is no longer used.
#
# v0.6		Last modified on 30 Mar 2014 by Ventsislav Zhechev
# Added a command-line option to specify the XX–EN engine.
# Added a command-line option to specify the cap on maximum not-full deployments to collect.
#
# v0.5.2	Last modified on 19 Mar 2014 by Ventsislav Zhechev
# Updated the status output.
#
# v0.5.1	Last modified on 17 Mar 2014 by Ventsislav Zhechev
# Added an accounting of the number of deployed instances to allow shutting down operation as soon as a full deployment is found.
# Rearranged the deployment details output order.
#
# v0.5		Last modified on 14 Mar 2014 by Ventsislav Zhechev
# Modified to only store progressively better deployments (i.e. leaving less and less memory unused).
# Execution is stopped after a maximum of 500 maximal deployments are found.
# Updated the statistics output after execution.
# Significantly optimised the engine placement algorithm by cutting off bad branches early.
#
# v0.4.1	Last modified on 10 Mar 2014 by Ventsislav Zhechev
# Updated the usage string.
# Now we are sorting the list of engines by memory requirement for deployment purposes.
#
# v0.4		Last modified on 13 Feb 2014 by Ventsislav Zhechev
# Added two extra printout modes to simplify the use of the output with other systems.
#
# v0.3		Last modified on 22 Jan 2013 by Ventsislav Zhechev
# Added progress dots.
# Parametrised server deployment order.
#
# v0.2		Last modified on 24 Dec 2012 by Ventsislav Zhechev
# Now we are inspecting all possible deployments.
#
# v0.1		Last modified on 21 Dec 2012 by Ventsislav Zhechev
# Initial version.
